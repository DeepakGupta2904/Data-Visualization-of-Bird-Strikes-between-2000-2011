# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011

Problem Statement:- Bird strikes, defined as collisions between birds and aircraft in flight or during take-off or landing, pose a significant threat to aviation safety. These incidents can lead to severe damage, especially to jet engines, and have resulted in fatal accidents. With the increasing number of vehicles and aircraft in urban areas, addressing the environmental impacts and safety concerns related to bird strikes has become crucial. This project aims to analyze data on bird strikes collected by the FAA between 2000-2011, focusing on various aspects such as frequency, impact, and cost implications.

Key Objectives:-

1. Visual Representation of Bird Strikes:- Create visuals to depict the number of bird strikes over the years, providing a clear understanding of trends and patterns.

2. Yearly Analysis:- Conduct a yearly analysis of bird strikes in the US, identifying any significant increases or decreases in incidents over time.

3. Airlines Analysis:- Identify the top 10 US airlines that have encountered the most bird strikes, analyzing factors that might contribute to higher incidence rates.

4. Airport Analysis:- Analyze and list the top 50 airports in the US with the most incidents of bird strikes, exploring any common characteristics among these airports.

5. Cost Analysis:- Evaluate the yearly cost incurred due to bird strikes, understanding the financial impact on the aviation industry.

6. Temporal Analysis:- Determine when most bird strikes occur (time of day, season, etc.), providing insights into peak risk periods.

7. Altitude Analysis:-

A. Analyze the altitude of airplanes at the time of strikes, identifying any altitude ranges that are more prone to incidents.

B. Investigate the average altitude of airplanes in different phases of flight when strikes occur.

8. Phase of Flight Analysis:- Study the phase of flight during which bird strikes are most common (take-off, initial climb, approach, landing), and assess the associated risks.

9. Impact Analysis:-

A. Examine the effect of bird strikes on flight, including any damage caused and the implications for flight safety.

B. Assess the effect of strikes at different altitudes, understanding how altitude influences the severity of impact.

10. Pilot and Warning Analysis:- Investigate whether pilots were informed about bird activity and the effectiveness of prior warnings in mitigating the impact of strikes.

Technologies and Tools:-

1. Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
2. Tableau/Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations

Skills Demonstrated:-

1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation
5. Aviation Safety Analysis
